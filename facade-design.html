                        We co-operate with Architect and other consultants during the initial project stages to ensure that the designs are optimal with no excessive and un-necessary facade systems.

                        Review the architectural drawings and prepare a Preliminary Facade Design Scheme for glazing, cladding, and other structures. We take into consideration environmental issues, safety and security, design life, flexibility, access, maintenance, and capital cost. We work with the design team to define performance criteria to develop the facade concepts and technical aspects of the design. Advise on material, manufacturing, and construction methods.

                Work closely with the design team to develop the Construction Strategy Report. Such strategy can consider specific aspects of the design that may affect the buildability and construction sequence of the project, to satisfy the Access and Maintenance Strategy. We design the facade taking into consideration shading systems and solar control glazing. We design the facade taking into consideration thermal performance, minimization of cold bridging, and assessment of condensation task.
